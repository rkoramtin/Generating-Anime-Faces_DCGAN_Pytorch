Deep convolutional generative adversarial network(DCGAN) is an extension of the GAN architecture for using deep convolutional neural networks for both the generator and discriminator.
In this project we have implemented both the generator and discriminator using pytorch for generating new anime based faces.

## Dataset:

This dataset consists of 21551 anime faces.All images are resized to 64 * 64.
